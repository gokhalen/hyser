This is a general list of things to do. 

1) Calculate the regularization functional only once.  (DONE)
2) Terminate newton iterations when the residual is small. (DONE)
3) Clear up the localize last iteration part              
4) Clear up localizer the hack in mesh.cpp were we build the CSR mapping. 
  
   --a lot of stuff can be cleared up if we split localizer into two functions

    a) localizer geometry
	
	localizer geometry would loclize coordinates dofns, FEM arrays	

    b) localizer fields 	
   
	localizer fields would loclize primal, dual, boundary data, matprops
      
    c) Write a function that prints a given two/three dimensional array to a given file. This can be used to clean up the printing of various arrays. 

5) There should be a different number of load iterations for each deformation fields.
6) Clean up Makefile
7) Autoconf/ Scons system
8) Use exceptions instead of assertions
